module Net
  # Make Socket calls resilient by adding timeouts, retries and specific
  # exception categories
  #
  # TCP Client with:
  # * Connection Timeouts
  #   Ability to timeout if a connect does not complete within a reasonable time
  #   For example, this can occur when the server is turned off without shutting down
  #   causing clients to hang creating new connections
  #
  # * Automatic retries on startup connection failure
  #   For example, the server is being restarted while the client is starting
  #   Gives the server a few seconds to restart to
  #
  # * Automatic retries on active connection failures
  #   If the server is restarted during
  #
  # Connection and Read Timeouts are fully configurable
  #
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ConnectionTimeout when the connection timeout is exceeded
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ReadTimeout when the read timeout is exceeded
  # Raises Net::TCPClient::ConnectionFailure when a network error occurs whilst reading or writing
  #
  # Note: Only the following methods currently have auto-reconnect enabled:
  #  * read
  #  * write
  #
  # Future:
  # * Add auto-reconnect feature to sysread, syswrite, etc...
  # * To be a drop-in replacement to TCPSocket should also need to implement the
  #   following TCPSocket instance methods:  :addr, :peeraddr
  #
  # Design Notes:
  # * Does not inherit from Socket or TCP Socket because the socket instance
  #   has to be completely destroyed and recreated after a connection failure

    #     Whether to use Nagle's Buffering algorithm (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagle's_algorithm)
    #     Recommend disabling for RPC style invocations where we don't want to wait for an

    #     Number of times to retry when calling #retry_on_connection_failure

    #
    #   :policy [Symbol|Proc]

    # 1. Example of a resilient _readonly_ request:
    #
    #    When reading data from a server that does not change state on the server
    #    Wrap both the send and the read with #retry_on_connection_failure
    #    since it is safe to send the same data twice to the server

    #      client.read(20).strip.to_i
    #    end
    #
    # 2. Example of a resilient request that _modifies_ data on the server:
    #
    #    When changing state on the server, for example when updating a value
    #    Wrap _only_ the send with #retry_on_connection_failure
    #    The read must be outside the #retry_on_connection_failure since we must
    #    not retry the send if the connection fails during the #read
    #
    #    value = 45
    #    # Only the send is within the retry block since we cannot re-send once
    #    # the send was successful since the server may have made the change
    #    client.retry_on_connection_failure do
    #      client.send("SETVALUE:#{count}\n")

    #    If a network failure occurrs during the block invocation the block
    #    will be called again with a new connection to the server.
    #    It will only be retried up to 3 times
